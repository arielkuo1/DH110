**Heuristic Evaluation** 

| Heuristic      | Evaluation     | Recommendation | Severity Rating | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- |
| Visibility of system status |**Good:** The title of the page is underlined when the user is on that page **Bad:** | N/A: The website exhibits clear visibility of the system status.  | N/A | 
|Match between system and the real world|   **Good:** The page titles are user-familiar words like "Lessons," "Tools," and "Products."  **Bad:** Although the page labels are clear, there is no description stating the purpose of these pages.   | Provide a description at the top of each page describing the purpose. For example, "Use our Exercises to practice your music theory knowledge." | 2 |
|User control and freedom| **Good:** On every lesson, exercise, or tools page, there is a home icon that can take the user back to the previous page.   **Bad:** 1. Once returning to the previous page using the home button, the user cannot return back to the same spot in their lesson/exercise because the progress is not saved.  2. The home icon only takes the user back one page, not to the actual home page of the website which can be misleading. | Include a button that clearly states "Back to Home" and another button for "Back to Lessons/Exercises/Tools" to give the user clarity and freedom. These can be implemented in a dropdown option. | 3 |
|Consistency and standards|  |  | |
|Error prevention|  |  | |
|Recognition rather than recall|  |  | |
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|  |  | |
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|  |  | |
|Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors|  |  | |
|Help and documentation|  |  | |
