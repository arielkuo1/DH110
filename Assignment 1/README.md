# Learning Music the Easy Way
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

DH 110: User Experience and Design 

**About the Project**  
For a middle-aged man, learning music theory online can be a daunting task with the overflow of information available. There are numerous options for learning, and it may be difficult to find one source that can fit the needs of the student. In this assignment, I will evaluate two different options for online music theory learning using Nielsen and Molich's 10 user interface design heuristics. 

### Option 1: musictheory.net

URL: https://www.musictheory.net/ 

**About the Website**  
The website musictheory.net is an online tool for learning music theory. The website includes free learning features like Lessons, Exercises, and Tools, as well as paid premium apps called Theory Lessons and Tenuto.

**Overall Evaluation** 
For a middle-aged man, this website is a pretty good starting point for learning music theory. The interface is kept very simple and is relatively easy to use. There is a lot of content and useful information on the website, and little unneccessary information shown. Overall, the website is sufficient but could use many improvements in the interface to create a better learrning experience for the user.

**Heuristic Evaluation** 

| Heuristic      | Evaluation     | Recommendation | Severity Rating | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- |
| Visibility of system status |**Good:** The title of the page is underlined when the user is on that page **Bad:** When doing an exercise, the title of the exercise is only shown for about 1 second before it is replaced with the user's score. This could cause the user to forget which exercise they are currently on. | At the top of the exercise page, the website should read "Exercise" as well as the exercise name such as "Key Signature Identification" during the whole duration of the exercise. | 2 | 
|Match between system and the real world|   **Good:** The page titles are user-familiar words like "Lessons," "Tools," and "Products."  **Bad:** Although the page labels are clear, there is no description stating the purpose of these pages.   | Provide a description at the top of each page describing the purpose. For example, "Use our Exercises to practice your music theory knowledge." | 2 |
|User control and freedom| **Good:** On every lesson, exercise, or tools page, there is a home icon that can take the user back to the previous page.   **Bad:** 1. Once returning to the previous page using the home button, the user cannot return back to the same spot in their lesson/exercise because the progress is not saved.  2. The home icon only takes the user back one page, not to the actual home page of the website which can be misleading. | Auto-save user progress within a lesson or exercise, and include a "Continue" option to allow the user to continue the lesson where they left off.  Include a button that clearly states "Back to Home" and another button for "Back to Lessons/Exercises/Tools" to give the user clarity and freedom. These can be implemented in a dropdown option. | 3 |
|Consistency and standards| **Good:** Page titles and terms are kept consistent throughout the website.  **Bad:** The brand's products are displayed twice, once on the home page and again under the "Products" page. This is redundant and can cause user confusion. | Get rid of the "Products" page, or link the product page to the home page to keep all of the same information in one place. | 3 |
|Error prevention| **Good:** There is little room for user error on the website, because lessons, exercises, and tools are executed with buttons only (no typing). **Good:** There is a "reset score" function within exercises in case one makes a mistake or wishes to start over. **Bad:** There is no single-action undo function, so if the user makes a mistake they have to reset their whole score rather than going back one step.  | Include an "undo" feature within exercises to give the user the ability to undo one error. | 3 |
|Recognition rather than recall| **Good:** There are no short-answer options, only button selection for answers (similar to multiple-choice). This prevents the user from having to recall information. **Bad:** Features in Exercises and Tools use terminology that one would have to recall from Lessons. | Include links to necessary/relevent lessons within the exercise or tool page. For example, the exercise "Key Signature Identification" should include a link to the lesson "Key Signatures". | 2 |
|Flexibility and efficiency of use| **Good:** The user can either click back and forth arrows or use the back and forth arrow keys on the keyboard to move within a lesson. **Bad:** All of the options within an exercise (such as "reset score" or "show timer" require an extra click on the top right corner to reveal the options, and there are no shortcuts for the options. | Include a sidebar on the exercise page with the available options for the user to minimize steps. | 2 |
|Aesthetic and minimalist design| **Good:** This website is very good about keeping uneccessary information to a minimum, considering how much content there is on the website. **Bad:** The website is very simple, and the lessons, exercises, and tools are organized as lists on those pages, which is not the most efficient organization because the user has to scroll to find their current lesson. | The lessons, exercises, and tools should be organized by section (like subfolders) rather than a long running list. | 1 |
|Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors| **Good:** There is little room for error on the website, and incorrect answers within an exercise are made clear with red coloring, while correct answers are in green. | N/A | N/A |
|Help and documentation| **Good:** Under the "Contact" page, users have the option to contact the company via a message box, and there is a link to frequently asked questions on this page. **Bad:** There is no search bar on the website if the user wishes to find information about a topic, and the title "Contact" does not make it clear this is where the user should go for help in general. | The page should be titled "Help", and then include options to go to the FAQ page or to submit a message. Also, include a search bar for the website so the user can easily find relevant information. | 4 |
