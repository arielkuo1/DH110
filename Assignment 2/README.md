# DH 110 Assignment 02: Usability Testing

## Introduction

musictheory.net is an online music theory learning tool. The website features free content such as lessons, exercises, and tools, as well as paid applications for premium learning.

A usability test (UT) is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Usability tests are a part of the process of improving the user's experience of a product. For musictheory.net, I found through heuristic evaluation that there are a few potential usability problems regarding user control, consistency, and help and documentation. The purpose of this usability test is to research how users may solve or face these problems with the interface, which would inform decisions to improve the website.

### About the test

The UT takes place in a portable minimalistic lab setting, with one laptop and a camera and microphone. This was a pilot test, with the purpose of testing out the equipment, setting, and materials for UTs. The participant sat in the same room as the instructor and had control over the computer when exploring musictheory.net. 

After informed consent was given, the participant answered background questions about the website, including their experience with the website, what they use it for, and what device they would normally access it on. Then, the participant answered a Pre-test questionnaire asking about how easy to use and trustworthy the website appears. The instructor then asked the participant to complete three tasks on the website that highlighted usability issues. After each task, the participant would check off how much of the task they were able to complete.

After the tasks were completed, the participant answered the Post-test questions, which were about how easy a task was, how long it took to perform, and how likely the user would be to perform it. Then, the user was asked to report how much they agree or disagree with the following statements:

I think that I would like to use this website frequently
I found the website unnecessarily complex
I thought the website was easy to use
I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this website
I found the various functions in this website were well integrated
I thought there was too much inconsistency in this website
I would imagine that most people would learn to use this website very quickly
I found the website very cumbersome to use
I felt very confident using the website
I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this website

Finally, the user filled out a product satisfaction card, choosing five words that matched their reactions to the website from the following list taken from NNGroup's adjectives:

Boring
Busy
Calm
Cheap
Creative
Cutting-edge
Exciting
Expensive
Familiar
Fresh
Impressive
Innovative
Inspiring
Intimidating
Old
Professional
Trustworthy
Unprofessional

The UT ended with demographic questions to avoid their influence on the participant's behavior during the test. These asked about age, gender, ethnicity, and primary language. 

The test was designed to collect data on the ease of use of the website, as well as participants' reactions and opinions of the website.
