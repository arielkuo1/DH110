A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103140524/163126029-641c5735-c9d3-48e5-a6f0-760217998011.png)
