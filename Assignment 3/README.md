# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
## Ariel Kuo DH 110

**Research goal**

This project mainly supports the online music theory learning experience for users. The research involves looking at people interested in learning music theory and what methods they would use. People these days have in-person options like taking lessons, joining courses, or self-teaching with the internet. One of the problems surrounding this topic is the fact that there are so many options. The abundance of content in real life and on the internet may be overwhelming to a new learner. The best solution would be a method that is all-encompassing, so that the user would not have to combine methods to achieve their goal. The goal of this project is to make the learning experience as user-friendly as possible.

**Target users**

The target user for this project is a middle-aged male that is interested in learning music theory, most likely at a beginner or intermediate level. They may have different motives and inspirations for learning. Some likely examples for this group would be learning a new instrument, picking up an old hobby, or just wanting to learn more about music in their free time. They could be motivated by participating in a musical social group, or they could be self-motivated to learn. Users would likely consider in-person and online options when taking on this task, also considering price as a factor.  

**Research method**

In this contextual inquiry, I employed participatory observation research to learn about the target audience and their needs. I conducted a zoom session in a casual interview format, asking the participant questions and observing the methods they show me themselves. Rather than giving the user specific tasks to complete, I let the participant show and explain their own methods to me. This method is very useful to understand the needs of the target audience without pushing specific ideas onto them about the product.

**Reflection**

In this field study, I learned a lot about the target audience and conducting research. 

The most prominent findings about the target audience of this research were:

1. Visual aid is essential to learn music theory
2. Users would willingly use online learning sources on their own
3. Users prefer methods that are simple, easy to use, interactive, and don't take up a lot of time

I also learned that every user's needs and experiences may be very different. This participant had previous experience learning music theory, and those methods differed from what they would use if learning currently. I learned that to properly observe the user, I needed to adapt the prompts and questions I provided them to fit their background. For example, I asked questions about what they did in the past and also what they would do now to learn more about music theory. I also needed to sometimes give further explanation to help guide the participant and sharing information. Overall, the CI was successful in teaching me about my target audience and about conducting research.
