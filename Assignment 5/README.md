# Assignment 5: Low-Fi Prototype

## Ariel Kuo DH 110

### The Purpose of the Low-Fi Prototype

The purpose of prototyping in design helps the designer envision how the user will interact with the product to complete tasks. This step in the creation process brings ideas to practical actionable steps. Creating low-fidelity prototypes are an effective, inexpensive way to test the usability of the proposed product.

### The Tasks in this Prototype

This prototype is designed to support two user tasks:

1. Complete the first lesson on musictheory.net
2. Complete the first exercise on musictheory.net using Game Mode

### Wireframes

### Wireflows

The purple pathways indicate the most straightforward way to complete the task for the user. 
The pink pathways indicate additional functions that can be completed during the task.

**Task 2: Complete the first exercise on musictheory.net using Game Mode**

### Testing the Prototype

A test subject was asked to complete the two tasks and draw their pathways on the wireflow during the task. The subject's points of confusion or dissatisfaction were observed to improve the prototype design.

### Reflection

When asked to complete the first task, the user progressed with ease until the Lesson 1 page when the "Sign In" button appears. They were not sure what to do if they did not have an account. To avoid confusion, the user started the lesson without signing in to track progress. They thought this meant they would not be able to save their progress after the lesson. 

The user did not face much trouble completing the second task. They chose to sign in after finishing the exercise, then proceeded to make an account as prompted.

To avoid confusion about what to do if they do not have an account, I could include an option to create an account under the "Sign In" button so that the user sees right away what their options are.

I also realized that having a sign in option both before and after the lesson could cause confusion. The test subject assumed not signing in at the beginning meant their data would be lost, but there was actually a later option to sign in after the lesson. In the second task wireflow (exercise), I only included one sign in option at the end of the exercise, which I think was a more straightforward and clear way to have that feature. This also allows the user to enjoy the experience of finishing a lesson or exercise before having to decide if they wanted to create an account and track their progress.
