# Assignment 6: Interface Design

## Ariel Kuo DH 110

### Project Goal & Purpose

The goal of this project is to redesign the musictheory.net website to facilitate smooth learning and increase user engagement. Ideally, the website will be welcoming and intuitive to a middle-aged man.
The interface design was first developed with a hand-sketched wireframe, then digitized in Figma. I then created many iterations of the design, altering assets like font, shape, and color. Finding the right design is essential to to improving the usability of the website.

### Digitized Wireflow
