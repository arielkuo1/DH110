# Assignment 4: Persona + Usage Scenario

### The Purpose of UX Storytelling

Creating a product requires a deep understanding of the target audience. In order to gain perspective from the user's side, researchers create personas that represent people who would use the product. Exploring the different challenges and emotions a user might feel can greatly improve the user-centered design. In this project, I am creating two personas of middle-aged men that wish to learn music theory for unique personal reasons. In telling their story, I aim to highlight proposed features of the product.

### Persona 1: Will Stevenson - church choir attendee

### Feature 1: Music theory lessons with progress visualizations

**Why would Will use the feature?**

After struggling at choir practice, Will embarked on a personal mission to learn how to read music. Will had never taken classes in music theory, and needed a safe, comfortable learning environment. After browsing through an array of websites overloaded with information, Will felt discouraged at first. The next day he revisited the activity and stumbled upon musictheory.net. To his surprise, he found easy-to-understand and encouraging lessons about music theory basics. Finishing a lesson gave Will a small sense of accomplishment and encouraged growth.

**How does Will experience the feature?**

From the homepage of musictheory.net, Will finds the "Lessons" tab and clicks on it. The page shows a list of available music theory lessons, numbered from start to finish and increasing in complexity. The first lesson, "The Staffs, Clefs, and Ledgerr Lines" is highlighted, indicating that this is the first step in learning. Will clicks on the first lesson, and the next page presents a clear, simple text line with the definition of a staff and visual examples. Once Will finishes reading and understanding the page, he clicks the forward arrow button to move on to the next page of the lesson. As he moves through the lesson, his progress is highlighted visually at the bottom of the screen as a horizontal bar fills up. Once he finishes the lesson, Will feels accomplished
