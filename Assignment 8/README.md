# Learning Music the Easy Way
### Ariel Kuo | Spring 2022 
DH 110: User Experience and Design 

### About the Project

For a middle-aged man, learning music theory online can be a daunting task with the overflow of information available. There are numerous options for learning, and it may be difficult to find one source that can fit the needs of the student. In this project, I aim to redesign the musictheory.net website to create an intuitive, clear way for individuals to learn music theory.

### Design Statement

Learning music can be overwhelming, especially finding cheap options that are easy to understand. In my design I aim to make the task as easy as possible for the user to achieve. The content is already free on the original website, so reformatting the information can be powerful. With this project I hope to offer a design solution for the daunting task of learning music theory online.

### Competitor Analysis 

The original website, musictheory.net, was analyzed using heuristic evaluation and usability testing.

**Heuristic Evaluation**

Based on the 10 heuristics, the original website is a pretty good starting point for learning music theory. The interface is kept very simple and is relatively easy to use. There is a lot of content and useful information on the website, and little unneccessary information shown. Overall, the website is sufficient but could use many improvements in the interface to create a better learrning experience for the user. One major implementation I would add is a function that saves the user's progress, so if they return to the website at a later time they can continue where they left off. In general, the original website is very basic in terms of its design and organization, and can be improved to be a more appealing website.

**Usability Testing**

Usability tests are a part of the process of improving the user's experience of a product. For musictheory.net, I found through heuristic evaluation that there are a few potential usability problems regarding user control, consistency, and help and documentation. The purpose of this usability test is to research how users may solve or face these problems with the interface, which would inform decisions to improve the website.

Through the testing process, I was surprised to learn that the participant's responses did not match my personal opinions of the website, and the participant did not have as hard of a time with the tasks as I had anticipated. This could be because the participant was not in the target audience and was the only sample, and conducting more UTs on the target audience would help create accurate data for improving the website.

### User Research

A contextual inquiry was conducted on a study participant within the target users, to better understand the challenges or preferences a user might have when using the product. The research involves looking at people interested in learning music theory and what methods they would use. 

From the user research, I came up with three main findings:

1. Visual aid is essential to learn music theory
2. Users would willingly use online learning sources on their own
3. Users prefer methods that are simple, easy to use, interactive, and don't take up a lot of time

### UX Storytelling

Exploring the different challenges and emotions a user might feel can greatly improve the user-centered design. In this project, I am creating two personas of middle-aged men that wish to learn music theory for unique personal reasons. In telling their story, I aim to highlight proposed features of the product. Two personas and usage scenarios were created to better understand the target audience. 

Here is an example of one of the personas and usage scenarios:
