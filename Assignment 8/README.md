# Learning Music the Easy Way
### Ariel Kuo | Spring 2022 
DH 110: User Experience and Design 

### About the Project

For a middle-aged man, learning music theory online can be a daunting task with the overflow of information available. There are numerous options for learning, and it may be difficult to find one source that can fit the needs of the student. In this project, I aim to redesign the musictheory.net website to create an intuitive, clear way for individuals to learn music theory.

### Design Statement

Learning music can be overwhelming, especially finding cheap options that are easy to understand. In my design I aim to make the task as easy as possible for the user to achieve. The content is already free on the original website, so reformatting the information can be powerful. With this project I hope to offer a design solution for the daunting task of learning music theory online.

### Competitor Analysis 

The original website, musictheory.net, was analyzed using heuristic evaluation and usability testing.
