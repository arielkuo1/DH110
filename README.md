# Learning Music the Easy Way: Redesigning musictheory.net

### Ariel Kuo | Spring 2022 
DH 110: User Experience and Design 

### About the Project

For a middle-aged man, learning music theory online can be a daunting task with the overflow of information available. There are numerous options for learning, and it may be difficult to find one source that can fit the needs of the student. In this project, I aim to redesign the musictheory.net website to create an intuitive, clear way for individuals to learn music theory.

### Design Statement

Learning music can be overwhelming, especially finding cheap options that are easy to understand. In my design I aim to make the task as easy as possible for the user to achieve. The content is already free on the original website, so reformatting the information can be powerful. With this project I hope to offer a design solution for the daunting task of learning music theory online.

### Competitor Analysis 

The original website, musictheory.net, was analyzed using heuristic evaluation and usability testing.

**Heuristic Evaluation**

Based on the 10 heuristics, the original website is a pretty good starting point for learning music theory. The interface is kept very simple and is relatively easy to use. There is a lot of content and useful information on the website, and little unneccessary information shown. Overall, the website is sufficient but could use many improvements in the interface to create a better learrning experience for the user. One major implementation I would add is a function that saves the user's progress, so if they return to the website at a later time they can continue where they left off. In general, the original website is very basic in terms of its design and organization, and can be improved to be a more appealing website.

**Usability Testing**

Usability tests are a part of the process of improving the user's experience of a product. For musictheory.net, I found through heuristic evaluation that there are a few potential usability problems regarding user control, consistency, and help and documentation. The purpose of this usability test is to research how users may solve or face these problems with the interface, which would inform decisions to improve the website.

Through the testing process, I was surprised to learn that the participant's responses did not match my personal opinions of the website, and the participant did not have as hard of a time with the tasks as I had anticipated. This could be because the participant was not in the target audience and was the only sample, and conducting more UTs on the target audience would help create accurate data for improving the website.

### User Research

A contextual inquiry was conducted on a study participant within the target users, to better understand the challenges or preferences a user might have when using the product. The research involves looking at people interested in learning music theory and what methods they would use. 

From the user research, I came up with three main findings:

1. Visual aid is essential to learn music theory
2. Users would willingly use online learning sources on their own
3. Users prefer methods that are simple, easy to use, interactive, and don't take up a lot of time

### UX Storytelling

Exploring the different challenges and emotions a user might feel can greatly improve the user-centered design. In this project, I am creating two personas of middle-aged men that wish to learn music theory for unique personal reasons. In telling their story, I aim to highlight proposed features of the product. Two personas and usage scenarios were created to better understand the target audience. 

Here is an example of one of the personas and usage scenarios:

![Will Stevenson](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%204/will.png)
![Empathy Map](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%204/empathy-will.png)
![Journey Map](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%204/journey-will.png)

**Feature 1: Music theory lessons with progress visualizations**

**Why would Will use the feature?**

After struggling at choir practice, Will embarked on a personal mission to learn how to read music. Will had never taken classes in music theory, and needed a safe, comfortable learning environment. After browsing through an array of websites overloaded with information, Will felt discouraged at first. The next day he revisited the activity and stumbled upon musictheory.net. To his surprise, he found easy-to-understand and encouraging lessons about music theory basics. Finishing a lesson gave Will a small sense of accomplishment and encouraged growth.

**How does Will experience the feature?**

From the homepage of musictheory.net, Will finds the "Lessons" tab and clicks on it. The page shows a list of available music theory lessons, numbered from start to finish and increasing in complexity. The first lesson, "The Staffs, Clefs, and Ledger Lines" is highlighted, indicating that this is the first step in learning. Will clicks on the first lesson, and the next page presents a clear, simple text line with the definition of a staff and visual examples. Once Will finishes reading and understanding the page, he clicks the forward arrow button to move on to the next page of the lesson. As he moves through the lesson, his progress is highlighted visually at the bottom of the screen as a horizontal bar fills up. Once he goes through all the pages, Will feels accomplished when he sees that he's completed the first lesson (shown visually with a green check mark). Motivated by his success, Will continues to use the lesson feature.

Overall, creating the personas and usage scenarios really helped me think through the logistics of the tasks. Imagining Will going through his first lesson on musictheory.net was helpful for me to design the wireflow related to that task.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of prototyping in design helps the designer envision how the user will interact with the product to complete tasks. This step in the creation process brings ideas to practical actionable steps. Creating low-fidelity prototypes are an effective, inexpensive way to test the usability of the proposed product. In this project, I created hand-drawn wireflows to exemplify going through two tasks, one lesson and one exercise. Then, I asked a test subject to draw on the wireflow as if they were going through the task, to see what steps they would take.

Here's an example of the first task, finishing the first lesson.

![Lesson 1 wireflow](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%205/wireflow-1.jpg)

From the process of creating a lo-fi prototype, I realized that having a sign in option both before and after the lesson could cause confusion. The test subject assumed not signing in at the beginning meant their data would be lost, but there was actually a later option to sign in after the lesson. In the second task wireflow (exercise), I only included one sign in option at the end of the exercise, which I think was a more straightforward and clear way to have that feature. This also allows the user to enjoy the experience of finishing a lesson or exercise before having to decide if they wanted to create an account and track their progress.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

The interface design was first developed with a hand-sketched wireframe, then digitized in Figma. I then created many iterations of the design, altering assets like font, shape, and color. Picking the right design is essential to to improving the usability of the website.

Here is the final design I chose based on the typeface and color variations:

![Wireframe](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%206/final.png)

After selecting the final variation, I asked a participant for their first impression of the website design. The participant's response to the first impression of my home screen matched my goal of creating a clean and intuitive environment. From the short exposure the participant was able to quickly get an insight on the purpose of the website and notice the separate options between free and paid content, which they appreciated.

When asked to criticize the design, the participant mentioned the fact that the user is already logged in, and they would like to see on the home page where the user would theoretically sign in. Taking this feedback, I have modified the profile icon to be a sign in button in the top right corner to show how a user might create or login to an account. After signing in, the user would see the original profile icon I included in the first design.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of creating prototypes is to realistically simulate the user's experience with the product, without going through a strenuous coding process. The process of creating an interactive prototype involves designing the interface in wireframes, then connecting them with animations in the correct sequence. During the process, the designer learns a lot about what obstacles or points of confusion a user might face, and about the configuration of interactions within the prototype.

Here's an example of creating a prototype in figma:

![Wireflow in figma](https://github.com/arielkuo1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment%207/task-1.png)

After creating my prototypes, I asked two classmates for their feedback in using the product.

Points of concern:

"some prototype interactions with homepage main buttons" are missing
"home page is covered at the left side"

Positive comments:

"I like the color scheme, it's professional and clear"
"I really liked the drop down option on the lessons menu!"

Addressing feedback:

- polished the prototype by including interactions for all main buttons, including home buttons and icons.
- made sure all sections of the screen were clearly visible in the prototype
- kept the color scheme and design due to positive feedback
- incorporated drop down option in the second task due to positive feedback on first task
